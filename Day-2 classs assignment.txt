Problem Statement:-Java Basic concepts 
Create a simple banking application that allows a user to perform the following operations using a menu-driven interface:

Check account balance
Deposit money
Withdraw money
Exit
The program should:

Use a switch statement to select the user's action.
Use a loop to repeatedly show the menu until the user chooses to exit.
Use basic data types like double for the account balance.
Perform basic operations such as addition, subtraction, and conditional checks (e.g., checking if the withdrawal amount is greater than the available balance).

OOPS Concepts:
class & objects:
Problem Statement:1
A bank needs to manage its customer information. Each customer has a name, account number, and balance. Create a Customer class that represents a customer in the bank, with attributes for the name, account number, and balance. Implement a method to display the customer details and another method to deposit money into the account.

Problem Statement:2-Inheritance
Extend the banking system by adding different types of accounts: SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount. Both should inherit from a base class called BankAccount. The SavingsAccount should have an interest rate attribute, while the CurrentAccount should have an overdraft limit.

Problem Statement:3-Polymorphism
In the banking system, implement a method to process withdrawals for both SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount using polymorphism. The withdrawal method should be defined in the base class and overridden in each derived class.

Problem Statement:-Abstraction
Create an abstract class BankAccount with abstract methods for deposit and withdrawal. The concrete classes SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount will implement these methods. Additionally, include a method to display the account details.

Problem Statement:-Interface Use Case
In a banking system, various types of bank accounts (like SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount) should implement a common interface for basic transactions such as deposit, withdraw, and displayBalance. The interface will ensure that all account types provide their own implementation of these methods.
