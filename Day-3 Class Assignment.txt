Day-3 Class Assignment:

Problem Statement-Custom Exception

In a banking application, itâ€™s crucial to manage errors effectively to ensure a smooth user experience. This includes handling scenarios such as:

Invalid Deposit Amount: Depositing a negative or zero amount should not be allowed.
Insufficient Funds: Attempting to withdraw more money than the current balance in a savings account.
Overdraft Limit Exceeded: Attempting to withdraw more than the available balance plus overdraft limit in a current account.
To handle these scenarios, create custom exception classes for each case, and integrate them into the SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount implementations

Problem statement -Multilevel inheritance
In a banking system, the functionality of accounts can be extended further by creating specialized account types. For instance, both SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount could have a specific type of account known as a PremiumAccount that offers additional benefits, such as higher interest rates for savings accounts


Account Management

Interface with Java -8 features:

Implement a base interface AccountOperations that defines common operations for all types of bank accounts. This interface should include:
Constant fields representing different account types (e.g., Savings, Current, Fixed).
Abstract methods for getting the account balance and account type.
A default method for generating an account summary.
A static method for validating account types.
Savings Account Operations

Extend the AccountOperations interface with a new interface SavingsAccountOperations that includes:
An abstract method for applying interest to the savings account.
Concrete Implementation

Create a SavingsAccount class that implements the SavingsAccountOperations interface. This class should provide:
A constructor to initialize the account with an initial balance.
Implementations for all abstract methods defined in the interfaces.
Logic to calculate and apply interest to the account balance based on a specified interest rate.
User Interaction

Develop a Main class that:
Creates an instance of SavingsAccount with an initial balance.
Allows users to view the account summary (account type and balance).
Allows users to apply interest to the account and view the updated balance.
Validates whether a specified account type is valid using the static method defined in the AccountOperations interface.
